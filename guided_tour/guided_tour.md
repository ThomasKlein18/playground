# Guided Tour

This is where we can collect ideas for the guided tour.

- "I want to start"-Button that ends the tour and lets people play with the network
- "I need the tour again"-Button in a prominent position that restarts the tour
- left/right-Buttons in the tour that start to blink discretly after some time has elapsed

# Stuff I need to add as hovering hints
+ explain epochs as "every data point was shown to the network once"
+ Training error needs to be small


# Offene Diskussionsfragen
+ Do we want to write two versions of the explanation, one for children and one for adults? Because some topics are hard but would be neat to have in there, like overfitting.

# Realization
+ two different modes: 
+ explanations that appear when hovering over the respective parts of the site and 
+ initial guided tour
+ @Chris: What makes more sense, showing the tour as a series of screenshots in which everything is grayed out except for the relevant part, or achieving that effect dynamically? I think the first option makes more sense because Gabi or I can do that, you'd just have to write code that handles displaying a series of images with three buttons (left, right and x)


# Bonus: Intelligent Tour
+ figure out what sort of information people need as they are interacting with the screen
