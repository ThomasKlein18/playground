# Tensorflow Playground

My adaptation of the official TensorFlow Playground, translated to german and reduced in complexity to suit the needs of our exhibition on the MS Wissenschaft.

## Development

To run the visualization locally, run:
- `npm i` to install dependencies
- `npm run build` to compile the app and place it in the `dist/` directory
- `npm run serve` to serve from the `dist/` directory and open a page on your browser.

For a fast edit-refresh cycle when developing run `npm run serve-watch`.
This will start an http server and automatically re-compile the TypeScript,
HTML and CSS files whenever they change.
